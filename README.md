# Generator-Web
This is a simple yeoman generator for me to practices the foundational pieces of the web that is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Its purpose is allow you to setup a sandbox environment without all the extra bells and whistles of unit testing, code linting and other plugins.

### Software Requirements
```
1. Node
2. NPM
3. Yeoman 
```
### Installation Instructions
```
1. git clone <repository url>
2. cd <repo>
3. npm install
4. npm link
```
### Creating and running the web app
Once you have installed the appropriate components and tools. You can simply scaffold out a simple static web app with the following commands:
```
1. yo web
2. npm start
```
This should fire up your web browser using browser-sync and watch the files in the current directory for any changes and reloads the browser.

### Application Structure
