# Generator-Web
This is a simple yeoman generator for me to practices the foundational pieces of the web that is HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Requirements
```
1. Node
2. NPM
3. Yeoman 
```

### Installation
```
1. git clone <repository url>
2. cd <repo>
3. npm link
```

### Creating and running the web app
Once you have installed the appropriate components and tools. You can simply scaffold out a simple static web app with the following commands:
```
1. yo web
2. npm start
```
This should fire up your web browser using browser-sync and watch the files in the current directory for any changes and reloads the browser.
